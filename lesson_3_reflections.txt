When would you want to crate a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To be able to share my work and collaborate
To keep my changes on a remote server for contigency
Make changes to my work from a remote location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you may be working on changes locally and do not want those changes overwritten or to impact the code you are currently working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub stored on the GitHub servers and placed under your profile. It is not stored locally. It is similar
to a clone, but not stored locally. A clone is a repository copied from the GitHub server to your local machine. Branches are a part of a report grouping commits together
logically. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To compare differences between local and the last remote copy
to view the last remote copy when you are offline
