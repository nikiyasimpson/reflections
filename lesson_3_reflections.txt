When would you want to crate a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To be able to share my work and collaborate
To keep my changes on a remote server for contigency
Make changes to my work from a remote location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you may be working on changes locally and do not want those changes overwritten or to impact the code you are currently working on.
