How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I think about all the times I could have saved myself a headache looking through hundreds of lines of code
looking for an error I created.  I just used the FC function in the Windows command prompt to see only the
differences in the files. I can't wait to look at Git some more to find more ways to save myself some
time as a developer.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Saving time when I create errors in my code! That's usually the majority of my time is testing and fixing bugs.
It is frustrating having to spend hours fixing something that you already fixed. I can get so much more accomplished.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The pros of manually choosing when to commit include flexibility over what code should be committed and how much at a time.
The cons is that you may forget to save your changes.
